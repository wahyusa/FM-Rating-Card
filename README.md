## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- Sveltekit
- TailwindCSS
- Coded with VSCode from Github Codespace ðŸ‘Œ

### What I learned

This is a great exercise for junior like me, at first I really think this is just simple ez pz but then I realize that is not easy as I think (at that time). But now, I think yep that was easy.

Honestly I didn't know how to manage state over components to show / hide the "thank you" page but thanks to sveltekit docs and REPL also some video from youtube I learn a lot about svelte basics and concept.

I also learn about typescript but I guess didn't use lot of em in this project, maybe I can found any other implementation next time.

### Continued development

If there was any possible implementation and best practice with typescript may be I should use that.
